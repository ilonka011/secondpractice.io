## Overview

This is one of the newbie-level projects offered for free on the Fronted Mentor website. HTML and CSS were used for this project; colors, fonts and the image were provided for me to use. The design includes a QR code (image) that's inside a box that also contains a title and a small paragraph.

## My process

After downloading the materials for the challenge, I looked at the mobile design and then at the desktop design and made observation about the most important details. I put the picture in the <div> which became a flexbox container later. I put all the text inside and set the colors for the background and for the texts (<p> and <h2>). I had a trouble aligning the header and the paragraph inside the box in the "pyramid-shape" way which unfortunately I wasn't able to resove. Then, I changed the margins, padding and size for the picture and the container using media query. After some time I was done. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Through this project I learned about READ.ME files on GitHub. I was introduced to some of the functions and things that are useful on GitHub.
Besides that, I learned about different padding types such as 'padding-inline' and 'padding-block' as I tried to align the text a certain way. 


### Continued development

As I continue learning more and more and improve my skills, I have a strong desire to understand flexbox and grid (css) in depth because it is much easier to use something when you logically understand it. I also want to learn how to align text in various ways.
